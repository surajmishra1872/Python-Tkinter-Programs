The reported departure of Chinese mobile-maker as the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League (IPL) Season 13 is set to have a big financial impact, not just on the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) but also on the franchises. The BCCI had a lucrative deal with VIVO that saw them earn INR 440 crore every year but the Indo-China face-off across the LAC, as well as the negative publicity of the smartphone brand, reportedly saw VIVO withdraw its name as IPL sponsor this season.
