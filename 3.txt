Speaking on Saturday in his first interaction with the media ahead of this yearâ€™s IPL, Warner said, "Bubble life is very challenging. It is the hardest thing not to have family with us due to restrictions. But these are unprecedented times due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The BCCI and organisers have done a fantastic job by putting this up. Obviously the next few months will be challenging. In Australia, we can go out and play golf and drive a car. Hopefully, we can do some recreational stuff. But first and the foremost is that the tournament gets going.
